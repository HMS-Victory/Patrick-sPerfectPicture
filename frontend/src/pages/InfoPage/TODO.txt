this page will be passed in an object with all of the data

example={
    header: "About Us"
    paragraph:{
        header: "title",
        content: "content"
    },
    paragraph:{
        header: "title",
        smallerHeader: "Smaller header"
        content: "content"
    }
}

the file will interperit paragraphs, and create elements based off of them
this will make this page more modular and we can use it for possibly many things
